# Good Practices for Software Development

## Question 1.
What is your one major takeaway from each one of the 6 sections? So 6 points in total.
___
1. **Gathering requirements:** Make sure to ask questions and seek clarity in the meeting itself. Since most of the time, it will be difficult to get the same set of people online again
2. **Always over-communicate Some scenarios:** Do not miss calls. If you cannot talk immediately, receive the call and inform them you will call back in 5-10 min, and call them back. This is a much better alternative than letting it go down as a missed call.
3. **Stuck? Ask questions:** Explain the problem clearly, mention the solutions you tried out to fix the problem
4. **Get to know your teammates:** Make time for your company, the product you are working on, and your team members. This will help a lot in improving your communication with the team.
5. **Be aware and mindful of other team members:** Remember they have their work to do as well. Pick and choose your communication medium depending on the situation.
6. **Doing things with 100% involvement:** Make sure you do some exercise to keep your energy levels high throughout the day.

## Question 2.
Which area do you think you need to improve on? What are your ideas to make progress in that area?
___
> I need to improve on the areas are mentioned below
1. Focus management
2. Take care of emotional and physical health
3. Doing things with `100%` involvement
4. Stuck? ask questions

**to improve these things I have some ideas to improve.**
* Focus management: I am thinking to start meditation and to improve my daily routine after I will spent some time with nature.
* To balance the emotional peaks and lows, I will take care of my mindfulness and some mind-relaxing musical binaural beats.
* To do things with `100%` involvement, I will focus on enjoyment during the work, not on the result with a growth mindset. to achieve `100%` involvement means going away from the rest of the world to do things and picking an appropriate work place.
* Whenever I will be stuck I will try to solve my problem myself by fixing a time limit. If it is not solved then if I have extra time to spend on that question then I will spend time on that otherwise according to the impotence of the problem and future relation of the problem I will spend time on that or I will take help from my friends or seniors
