# Learning-process

## Question 1. 
What is the Feynman Technique? Paraphrase the video in your own words.
***
We must be honest with ourselves. When we are learning something don't ignore anything. Feynman's technique was the name of the great physicist.

There are some steps to apply the Feynman technique during our learning process.

1.  Write the name of the topic at the top you want to learn as the main heading.
2.  Go to the resources and read the book or watch the lecture.
3.  Whatever you learn write it in simple language as much as possible.
4.  Identify the problem where you are facing the problem and then go back to the resources for review.
5.  Pinpoint the complicated terms and challenges to simplify the learning.

## Question 2.
What are the different ways to implement this technique in your learning process?
***
1. To learn any new topic first of all don't try to be a master in one go.
2. First, take an overview of the topic and then find some appropriate resources to read.
3. Read that and try to explain in your own words by making it simple.
4. Figure out those points where you are stuck.
5. then read again those points from different resources until it's not clear.
6. try to explain again and highlight the difficult area.
7. Discuss with your friends.

## Question 3.
Paraphrase the video in detail in your own words.
In the video, there is a detailed explanation of how to learn anything effectively. It is explained that our brain is enormously complex. We can divide it into two simple fundamental modes regarding learning or practicing or doing anything.
1. The first mode we can call a focus mode means you can turn your attention to something and think tightly. It will involve us in some familiar thought
2. The second mode is different we can say it is the relaxed state of the brain or the diffuse mode

when we learn something new our brain lies between these two states.
when we feel focused or stuck we need to stay away from the topic and take a rest. Let it solve by the brain in the background.

when we are trying to do something and are not able to do it. we feel a physical pain that is analyzed pain.

we can remove it by doing that work continuously or by doing some pleasant work. But is no better way to handle it

So to handle it in a good way can use a simple technique `Pomodoro technique`. According to this technique take a timer of 20 or 25 minutes without any restriction and do whatever you are doing by focusing and then take rest.

Different people have different abilities so first of all, analyze yourself and work on what is suitable for you.

## Question 4.
What are some of the steps that you can take to improve your learning process?
***

I can improve my learning by applying the Pomodoro technique and Feynman technique.
By practicing any topic again and by applying practical approaches by playing games based on the related topic.

## Question 5.
Your key takeaways from the video? Paraphrase your understanding.
***
According to starting part of the video it is mentioned the 10,000 rule. That means to be an expert in any subject any skill either physical skill or any mental skill we need deliberate practice for 10,000 hours. This theory was given after research on the champion athlete or musician or chess player.
But in the later part of the video, it was explained that to learn anything good level we need to practice for only 20 hours.

to learn in 20 hours try to classify the skills in more and more and find out the most important parts of that skill. Then collect some 3 to 5 resources to learn them after practice that for 20 hours.
***

## Question 6.
What are some of the steps that you can while approaching a new topic?
First of all, I will take an overview from any expert or any resource like a short introduction.
After that, I will figure out the important parts and collect some resources and learn the theoretical part of that. Now it's time to practice enough to be comfortable with that topic.
